            <h1><i>Welcome</i></h1>
            <p>Inspired by the vision and directions of the Founder St. Louis Mary De Montfort, the Brothers of St. Gabriel 
               opened this Institution named MONTFORT SCHOOL on 25th July 1994. I am pleased to welcome you to the 
		Montfort School Website.</p>
                 <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                 <p>The Montfortian mission is to help the young develop into upright, creative and loyal citizens imbued with
                    love and concern for others, spiritual sensitivity and a sense of personal freedom, liberty of thought, 
                    expression, belief, faith and Worship, equality of status and of opportunity and fraternity assuring the
                    dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of nations. It envisions enabling the young to 
                    develop into a holistic personality and earn a living; and contributing to the economic, social, political
                    and cultural progress of the nation.</p>
                 <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                 <p>Apart from the vision of Christian schools, Montfortian education, in particular, aims to prepare the student
                   for a life that is worth living. As individuals and members of the society the students need to be helped to 
                   develop qualities of the mind and heart as well as basic skills and attitudes. To achieve this the Montfortian 
                   education system is designed as person-oriented, social or the other oriented, professional or work oriented, 
                   national or citizen oriented and universal brotherhood and international understanding oriented.</p>
